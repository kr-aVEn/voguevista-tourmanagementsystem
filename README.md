# voguevista-tourmanagementsystem
a J2EE web application as a course project that manages tour packages, bookings, and customer details using JSP .
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\


Here we have done a course project on tourmanagement system on jsp
here we intergated javascript to cooperate with map api :overleaf   and used Wikipedia api for searching.
used postgresql for the db
Still this project is not completed. its still lacks some features or features not implemented yet like review, booking managing, rating, custom packages..
Still contain some bugs /loop holes on session management, db normalisations ,querries i, irrelavant features like changing username along with email by the user itself


|\\\\
Still have a large scope on this project
If had chance I like to improve the project, I have some ideas on the future scope involving machine learning.. 
1)recommending places package based on users previous travel history, 
2)recommendation based on previous place visit while visitng a new place.
3)booking of hotels , cabs for a location
4)finding best routes and travel planing for the interested places..
